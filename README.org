* Notes
** Disclaimer: This is experimental code, use at your own risk.
  
** Please note that this repository uses Git LFS.  You must:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git lfs clone https://github.com/ecbrown/QTAIM.wl.git
#+END_src

* What

Wolfram Language (Mathematica) Package for computations involving the
Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM)

* Why

I have always wanted a high-level Mathematica interface to
commonly-performed QTAIM tasks. This is for both research and teaching
purposes, especially creating highly customized graphics.

* Installation Notes
** MathLink Executable

In order to use this code, you must build a MathLink executable. You
then have to patch up the code to use it. An example, using MacPorts
gfortran and MathLink's mcc:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  gfortran-mp-10 -O3 -fPIC -c -o read_wfn.o read_wfn.f90
  # mprep
  mcc read_wfn.tm read_wfn.o read_wfn.tm main.c -o read_wfn
#+END_src

* Example Uses

** Wavefunctions
   - WFX (not WFN yet, needs to be hooked up)
   - PySCF (examples give full-valence CASSCF of water)
  
** Electron Density of Water (Center Planes)

   Mathematica 12 has beautiful slice plots:

** Locate Nuclear Critical Points (and Plot Them)
   The first task is locate the nuclear critical points:
   
[[https://github.com/ecbrown/QTAIM.wl/blob/master/resource/nuclear-critical-points-of-water.png?raw=true]]

** Locate Bond Critical Points (and Plot Them)
   The second task is locate the bond critical points. This uses a
   graphical technique inside of Mathematica. There are no heuristics.

** Electron Density of Water (Contour Plot)

  Symmetrical molecules contain a lot of information along planes.

** Electron Density of Water (Contour Plot)

  It is easy to compose images with different quantities. The bond
  paths shown in the 3D model above can be projected onto the plane:

** Electron Density Gradient of Water (Stream Plots)

   In the QTAIM, atoms are defined by regions of space that are the
   union of all steepest ascent paths through the electron density and
   the attractor.

** (Negative of) Laplacian of Electron Density

   "Lone Pairs" of electrons can be located by finding maxima in the
   negative of the Laplacian of the electron density.  A feature of
   QTAIM.wl is that is uses the same techniques to find critical
   points in the Laplacian as it does in the electron density.
